# MSPTP

This is the attack implementation for the "MS-PTP: Protecting Network Timing from Byzantine Attacks" paper. The readers need to deploy a local network with three Raspberry Pi 4 nodes to launch the attack. All nodes shall install the following packets:
-UDPdump
-PTPD2

The ieee1588.py file contains all modified packets to launch the attack.
